USER STORY (help identify goals)
    *As an ... visitor to the Horison website.

    *So that ... people with disabilities can have a more full experience from the website.
    
_ **AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines**_


ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (how to know when goals are acheived)
    *When ... a person wth vision disability visits the site
    *Then ... images and links have a 'read aloud component
    *And ... the website is constucted semanticaly so parts of website can be identified through a screen reader.
    *And ... all links are functional

_**GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title**_
